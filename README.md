# Workflows and Package Management

Reproducibility and package management techniques: workflow languages (CWL, Snakemake, and Conda). This course introduces some of the approaches for package management and how to create reproducible workflows or pipelines. 

### Competencies
This session seeks to impart the following competencies:
1. Knowledge and skills: Bioinformatics tools and their usage.
2. Knowledge and Skills: Command line and scripting based computing skills appropriate to the discipline.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, and the projects that follow, the learner should be able to:
1. Select the best workflow and package managers based on the task at hand
2. Implement a genomic pipeline in at least one workflow manager
3. Set up a reproducible analysis environment

## Outline
- Introduce the high-level concept of workflows and high throughput data analysis
- Hands-on activities for setting up the packages
- Introduce package management and how we can use conda to increase reproducibility with workflows
- Introduce the theory of workflows: with emphasis on one language (say, snakemake)
- Hands-on activities of developing workflows
